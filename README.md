<h2>What’s a Many-to-Many relationship?</h2>

<p>In our system, we don’t want to duplicate amenities (for example, having 10000 time the amenity Wifi), so they will be unique. But, at least 2 places can have the same amenity (like Wifi for example). We are in the case of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>an amenity can be linked to multiple places</li>
    <li>a place can have multiple amenities</li>
</ul>
<strong>= Many-To-Many</strong>
